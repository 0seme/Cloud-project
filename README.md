## Server Setup

I had already provisioned an EC2 instance from a previous setup. Below are the details and steps I took to prepare the server environment:

- **Instance Type**: t2.micro (Free Tier)  
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS  
- **Public IP Address**: `176.34.250.79`  
- **Elastic IP**: Enabled for persistent IP  

### Steps Taken

**Access the Server via SSH**

**Command Run:**
```bash
ssh -i <key-name>.pem ubuntu@176.34.250.79
```

**Opened Required Ports via AWS Security Group:**
- TCP Port 22 (SSH)
- TCP Port 80 (HTTP)
- TCP Port 443 (HTTPS)

## Web Server Setup

Initially, Apache2 was running on the server from a previous configuration. Since I planned to use Nginx, I had to stop and disable Apache first.

### Steps Taken

**Stop and Disable Apache2**

**Commands Run:**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop apache2
sudo systemctl disable apache2
```

**Install Nginx**

**Commands Run:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

**Start and Enable Nginx**

**Commands Run:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

**Verify Nginx Installation**

Open in browser:
```
http://176.34.250.79
```

## Deployment

I wrote the HTML for the landing page (index.html) based on the CareLink project and deployed it to the server.

### Steps Taken

**Navigate to the Web Root Directory**

**Command Run:**
```bash
cd /var/www/html
```

**Replace Default index.html**

**Command Run:**
```bash
sudo nano index.html
```

I pasted the HTML code for the CareLink landing page and saved the file.

**Verify Deployment**

Refreshed the browser to confirm that the custom CareLink landing page was live at:
```
http://176.34.250.79
```

## HTTPS Setup (Let's Encrypt + DuckDNS)

Since I did not own a custom domain, I used DuckDNS, a free dynamic DNS service, to secure the site with HTTPS.

### Steps Taken

1. Registered a free subdomain at https://www.duckdns.org
   - **Subdomain chosen:** cloudbyjoyce
   - **Full domain:** cloudbyjoyce.duckdns.org
   - Linked it to my EC2 instance's public IP

**Install Certbot and Nginx Plugin**

**Command Run:**
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

**Request SSL Certificate**

**Command Run:**
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d cloudbyjoyce.duckdns.org
```

Followed the interactive prompts, accepted the terms, and the SSL certificate was issued and automatically configured.

**Verify HTTPS**

Visit in browser:
```
https://cloudbyjoyce.duckdns.org
```

Certbot also scheduled automatic SSL renewal using a system timer.
